# Game Implementation Techniques


## Project_0_BasicFramework
The objectives for this Project are three-fold:  
o	To implement tracing/logging functionality.  
o	To implement scene loading and unloading.  
o	To implement the DigiPen Graphics Library demo code as a new scene.  

## Project_1_EngineFlow
The objectives for this Project are two-fold:  
o	To implement a game engine flow that can switch between three scenes and restart a scene, while executing the correct order of state function calls (Load, Init, Update, Render, Exit, and Unload).  
o	To implement a module for performing mathematical operations on the Vector2D structure. These mathematical operations will be used in the third scene.  

## Project_2_Graphics
The objectives for this project are four-fold:  
o	To implement entities using component-based design.  
o	To implement entity construction using deserialization.  
o	To implement functionality for positioning and moving entities.  
o	To implement functionality for displaying entities.
